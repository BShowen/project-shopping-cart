## Project goal: Learn more React!
I have been reading up on React router, and React testing with Jest. I am also very new to React hooks. So in this project I am creating a small e-commerce website, with a focus on Hooks, Tests, and React router. I also want this website to be mobile friendly, so I am using bootstrap for my layout.
